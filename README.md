# Forte - Hostel Management System



**Forte** is a web application designed to simplify hostel management for both administrators and students. The frontend is powered by **Next.js** and incorporates improvements from the **DashUI** template by [Codescandy](https://codescandy.com/). The backend is built with **Django**.

This is the latest update, bringing a better user experience and streamlined processes. If you have feedback or suggestions for the latest improvements, please [contact me](mailto:mrptjobs@gmail.com).

For users who prefer the older React-based frontend, it is still available at [https://fortebyphil.pythonanywhere.com/](https://fortebyphil.pythonanywhere.com/) but please note, that version is outdated and will not receive further updates.
